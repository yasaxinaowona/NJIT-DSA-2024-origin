### Report on HashBookImplementation

1. **Hash Function for Hash Table Solution**:
   - The HashBookImplementation class uses the 'hashCode()' method of the Words class to implement the hash function used in. Calculate the hash code for each word by summing the ASCII values of the characters and applying multiplication factors and addition.

2. **Correctness of Implementation**:
   - Overall, the implementation seems to be correct, handling reading from files, counting unique words, and managing conflicts in the hash table. However, when collisions occur, potential problems can arise in edge cases in the hash function or in the hash table resizing process.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the implementation varies:
   - Read and manage words :O(n), where n is the number of words in the input file.
   - Get the top 100 list :O(n log n), which involves sorting an array of words using quick sort.
   - Sorting algorithm: The sorting algorithm uses quicksort, and the average time complexity is O(n log n).
   - Overall, the code is more efficient at reading and managing words, but sorting top-100 lists becomes inefficient for very large data sets.

4. **Most Difficult Things to Understand and Implement**:
   - Understanding and implementing hash functions and dealing with conflicts in hash tables can be challenging because of the need to ensure efficient allocation of keys and minimize the complexity of conflicts.
   - It is also difficult to manage the resizing of hash tables and handle edge cases during word counts.

5. **Learning Experience**:
   - This programming task provided insights into implementing data structures like hash tables and dealing with challenges such as collisions and resizing.
   - Emphasis on understanding efficiency considerations in file processing, sorting algorithms, and algorithm design.
