### Report on HashBookImplementation

1. **Hash Function for Hash Table Solution**:
   - The hash function used in the HashBookImplementation class is implemented in the `hashCode()` method of the Words class. It computes a hash code for each word by summing up the ASCII values of its characters and applying a multiplication factor and addition.

2. **Correctness of Implementation**:
   - The implementation appears to be correct overall, handling reading from files, counting unique words, and managing collisions in the hash table. However, potential issues could arise from edge cases in the hash function or during the resizing of the hash table when collisions occur.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the implementation varies:
     - Reading and managing words: O(n), where n is the number of words in the input file.
     - Getting the top-100 list: O(n log n), as it involves sorting the array of Words using quicksort.
     - Sorting Algorithm: Quicksort is used for sorting, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n).
   - Overall, the code is relatively efficient in reading and managing words, but sorting the top-100 list could become inefficient for very large datasets.

4. **Most Difficult Things to Understand and Implement**:
   - Understanding and implementing the hash function and handling collisions in the hash table might have been challenging due to the complexity of ensuring efficient distribution of keys and minimal collisions.
   - Managing resizing of the hash table and handling edge cases during word counting could also be difficult.

5. **Learning Experience**:
   - This programming task provided insights into implementing data structures like hash tables and dealing with challenges such as collisions and resizing.
   - It enhanced understanding of file handling, sorting algorithms, and efficiency considerations in algorithm design.
